* Backwards compatibility for getCurrentOrg and getCurrentSpace getCurrentOrg returns Organization
getOrg returns OrganizationDetails [#97159474]

* Merge pull request #480 from cloudfoundry/missing_service_key_delete
  - Missing service key coloring message from dsk  now matches the coloring from ds
* Reduce service_access API requests: orgs - To map org guids to org names, we make individual requests for each
  org instead of requesting all orgs. [#96912380]
  - This is optimized for the case where there are fewer orgs associated
    with service_plan_visibilities than the total number of org pages.
    This seemed to be the case on all environments we checked.
  - /v2/organizations does not support filtering on a list of org or
    service_plan_visiblility guids, so we have to make separate GETs
- In plan_builder, there are package variables that are used to memoize
  maps. This causes pollution plan_builder tests, so we nil them in test
  setup
* Reduce service_access API requests: service plans [#96912380]

* Change fake and refactor app_bits repo. - App bits repo is much more tightly scoped
- The App Bits repo has a counterfeiter fake, and lives in its own
  package
- Some callbacks met their demise
- We now have a push actor
- Former responsibilities of the App Bits repo have been divided between
  the App Bits repo, the push command, and the push actor.
- All this should make the future implementation of an "upload bits"
  command much easier/possible.
